./GetAll.sh


in cmpXmean in main(), need to choose whether to use plotSsigma or not;-)
similar in drawCmpGraphs.py (there it's governed by xtag)
in drawCmpGraphs, also select which set of graphs to compare (grsNames*)

default model: (adds automatically also one more directory, root_Inel_0.45_sigmaInel_0.2_C_10_Csigma_3_mnlEM1.125_mnlHad999.0)
./cmpXmean.py root_Inel_0.45_sigmaInel_0.2_C_10_Csigma_3_mnlEM1.125_mnlHad999.0_testNoNewPhysWithNewPhysArea

./runCmpAll.sh
